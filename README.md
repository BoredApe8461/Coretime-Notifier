### Coretime Notification API

This project allows parachain teams and users to subscribe to notifications about Coretime-related events that occur or are about to occur on-chain.

## Interesting Crates to Consider
- [Storage](./services/storage/) => Uses SQLite to store data into a filesystem locally. Do not modify the `.db` folder as this is automatically generated and updated with more rows representing the Table's values.
- [API](./services/api/)
- [Tracker](./services/tracker/)
